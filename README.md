# welovecomedy_real-world-project

Contributed to a Real-World Collaboration with a Top-Rated Upwork Freelancer. While the work presented here represents my committed effort and solutions, it's important to note that this is an intermediate stage of the project, showcasing the specific tasks I was entrusted with. As you explore the code, please keep in mind that this is not the final, polished version. It only provides a transparent glimpse into the iterative nature of my work, highlighting my involvement and the collaborative journey I embarked upon. I thoroughly enjoyed strengthening my knowledge in HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript.
